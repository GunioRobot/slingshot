(defmacro try+
  "Like the try special form, but with enhanced catch clauses:

    - catch non-Throwable objects thrown by throw+ as well as
      Throwable objects thrown by throw or throw+;

    - specify objects to catch by class name, key-value pair,
      predicate, or arbitrary selector form;

    - destructure the caught object;

    - in a catch clause, access the names and values of the locals
      visible at the throw site, including the name of the enclosing
      function and its arguments (unless shadowed by nested locals).

  A selector form is a form containing one or more instances of % to
  be replaced by the thrown object. If it evaluates to truthy, the
  object is caught.

    The class name, key-value pair, and predicate selectors are
    shorthand for these selector forms:

      <class name>  => (instance? <class name> %)
      [<key> <val>] => (= (get % <key>) <val>)
      <predicate>   => (<predicate> %)

  &throw-context is a local acessible within try+ catch clauses. It is
  a map containing:
  The binding form in a try+ catch clause is not required to be a
  simple symbol. It is subject to destructuring which allows easy
  access to the contents of a thrown collection.

    - for Throwable caught objects:
      :object       the caught object;
      :message      the message, from .getMessage;
      :cause        the cause, from .getCause;
      :stack-trace  the stack trace, from .getStackTrace;
      :throwable    the caught object;

    - for non-Throwable caught objects:
      :object       the caught object;
      :message      the message, from the optional arguments to throw+;
      :cause        the cause, captured by throw+, see below;
      :stack-trace  the stack trace, captured by throw+;
      :throwable    the outermost Throwable wrapper of the caught object,
                    see below;
      :environment  a map from names to values for locals visible at
                    the throw+ site.

  To throw a non-Throwable object, throw+ wraps it in a Throwable
  context wrapper. That wrapper may in turn end up wrapped by other
  exceptions (e.g., instances of RuntimeException or
  java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException). When processing catch
  clauses, try+ sees through any such wrappers to find the thrown
  object. If needed, the outermost wrapper is available within a catch
  clause via the :throwable key in &throw-context. Any nested wrappers
  are accessible via its cause chain.
  The hidden local &throw-context is visible within try+ catch
  clauses, bound to the throw context for the caught object.

  When throw+ throws a non-Throwable object from within a try+ catch
  clause, the outermost wrapper of the caught object being processed
  is captured as the cause of the new throw+.
