      &throw-context hidden argument.

  A typespec is a map with one entry:
    - the key is the hierarchy (or nil for the global hierarchy);
    - the value is the type tag: a keyword or symbol.

  &throw-context is a map containing:
    :obj the thrown object;
    :stack the stack trace;
  for all caught objects, and
    :env a map of bound symbols to their values;
    :next the next throw context in the cause chain
  for objects that are not instances of Throwable.
